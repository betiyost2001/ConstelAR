    "description": "Prior to TEMPO, air quality data from space was available only once a day. TEMPO breaks this barrier by being mounted on a commercial communications satellite in a geostationary orbit. This revolutionary positioning allows it to stare continuously at the same large area (North America), capturing hourly snapshots of pollution during the entire day. This level of detail is critical for understanding pollution sources, forecasting air quality, and protecting public health across the continent.",
